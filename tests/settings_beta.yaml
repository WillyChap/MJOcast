#==============================
#config_cam_baseline_example.yaml

#This is the main CAM diagnostics config file
#for doing comparisons of a CAM run against
#another CAM run, or a CAM baseline simulation.

#Currently, if one is on NCAR's Casper or
#Cheyenne machine, then only the diagnostic output
#paths are needed, at least to perform a quick test
#run (these are indicated with "MUST EDIT" comments).
#Running these diagnostics on a different machine,
#or with a different, non-example simulation, will
#require additional modifications.
#
#Config file Keywords:
#--------------------
#This first set of variables specify basic info used by all diagnostic runs:

base_dir: ./../MJOcast/

    # ++++ OBSERVATIONS ++++
    #standard setting to apply the era obs:
    #if you are not using ERA5 data, please set up your files as you see the obs file in the ./Observations folder
    #the variable names and dimension orders must be the same. Place the file in the ./Observations folder
    use_era5: True
    
    #this variable is not used if use_era5 is true
    usr_named_obs: alternative_name_of_obs.nc

    #Location of observational datasets:
    #Note: This must be modified if era5 data is not to be used.
    #isn't specified in the variable defaults file.

    # ---- OBSERVATIONS -----
    
    # ++++ Forecasts ++++
    #Location where forecast files are stored:
    #NOTE ... forecast files must contain: OLR, U200, U850 variables
    forecast_data_loc: ./test_cases/Standard_Case
    #note the forecast files must have the initalization time in the name file path with form: *01apr1999.nc
    #... no other dates should be present in the file names...
    #TODO make this more generalizable see the function "conver_dates_to_string()" in the development notebook.
    #I think you can add a column to the dataframe to handle this...

    #Number of processors on which to run the file.
    #If this config variable isn't present then
    #the ADF defaults to one processor.  Also, if
    #you set it to "*" then it will default
    #to all of the processors available on a
    #single node/machine:
